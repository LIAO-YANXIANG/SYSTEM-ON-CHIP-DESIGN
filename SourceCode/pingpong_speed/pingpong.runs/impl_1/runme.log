WARNING: [DRC PDRC-153] Gated clock check: Net CRC3_0/CLK is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin CRC3_0/led_r[7]_i_3/O, cell CRC3_0/led_r[7]_i_3. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
WARNING: [DRC PLHOLDVIO-2] Non-Optimal connections which could lead to hold violations: A LUT CRC3_0/led_r[7]_i_3 is driving clock pin of 8 cells. This could lead to large hold time violations. Involved cells are:
led_r_reg[0], led_r_reg[1], led_r_reg[2], led_r_reg[3], led_r_reg[4], led_r_reg[5], led_r_reg[6], and led_r_reg[7]
